# Code Quality Review

Review all code created or modified during the current task.

## Project consistency

Before suggesting a new pattern:

1. Search for similar implementations.
2. Follow the existing project organization.
3. Reuse existing helpers and abstractions when appropriate.
4. Do not introduce a new convention without a clear benefit.

## Readability

Verify that:

- Names communicate business intent.
- Functions have one clear responsibility.
- Complex conditions are understandable.
- Control flow is not unnecessarily nested.
- Comments explain decisions, not obvious syntax.
- Constants replace unexplained magic values.
- Public behavior is understandable from the code.

## Complexity

Look for:

- Functions doing unrelated work
- Excessive branching
- Deep nesting
- Repeated conditions
- Duplicate transformations
- Premature abstractions
- Generic utilities used by only one call site
- Unnecessary indirection
- Hidden side effects

Prefer simple and explicit code over clever code.

## Types and contracts

Verify that:

- Types are specific and meaningful.
- Unsafe casts are avoided.
- Null and undefined cases are handled.
- Public contracts are not silently changed.
- Return values and failure behavior are predictable.
- DTOs and interfaces represent their real domain purpose.

Do not use broad types such as `any`, generic maps, or untyped objects when a
more accurate type can reasonably be defined.

## Duplication

Remove duplication only when the duplicated behavior represents the same
business concept.

Do not merge code merely because it looks structurally similar.

## Scope control

Confirm that the diff contains only changes required for the task.

Flag:

- Unrelated refactors
- Unrequested formatting changes
- Dependency upgrades
- Renaming outside the affected scope
- Public API changes
- Behavior changes without tests

### Naming and cognitive load

Check:

* Are names understandable without inspecting their types?
* Are parameters named after their domain meaning?
* Are abbreviations unnecessary or project-specific?
* Are single-letter names used for values with business meaning?
* Are generic names such as `data`, `item`, `value`, `object`, or `result`
  hiding more specific concepts?
* Does the reader need to search another file to understand an identifier?
* Do names distinguish similar concepts clearly?
* Are names still accurate after the implementation changed?

Prefer names that make the code understandable at first glance.

For example:

```ts
const loadList = async (filter: FitbankWebhookAuditFilter) => {}
```

is clearer than:

```ts
const loadList = async (f: FitbankWebhookAuditFilter) => {}
```

Do not request longer names mechanically.

Accept established abbreviations such as `id`, `url`, `api`, `http`, and
project-standard terms when they are clearer than their expanded forms.


## Completion criteria

The review is complete only when:

- The code follows existing patterns.
- The implementation is understandable.
- Unnecessary complexity has been removed.
- Relevant contracts remain stable.
- No unrelated changes remain.
